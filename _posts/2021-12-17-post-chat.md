H: Hi, [Miko](https://youtu.be/CsQjxEd-gsw)! You're just in time-- my hard work on MIKOGAN is done. This [GAN](https://www.iangoodfellow.com/slides/2016-12-9-gans.pdf) is breaking new ground by logging and translating your speech and gesture rhythyms into audio outputs. In each and every stream you'll be conducting a soundtrack supplement for your fans. Bravo!  

M: Wah! I feel honored. I'm so happy-- as evidenced by my avatar-smile tracking the underlying classic skin-and-muscles smile.
